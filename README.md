**Introduction**
------
* Paid streaming services such as Netflix or Spotify do not leverage paid members’ data for online advertising and therefore not as much under attention as other platforms like Facebook or Google in user data research and ethics discussions. 

* However, these platforms leverage user data to improve their personalization algorithms which eventually serves to gain new users and retain existing ones.

* All paid members opt in for personalization by default without a chance to evaluate whether they are willing to receive personalization in exchange for allowing platforms to utilize their personal data.

* This study claims that when explicitly informed, users may perceive the usage of their data for personalization algorithms as a means of compensation and prefer paying less for the paid online streaming services.

* This study also aims to find if personalization was ever optional in paid streaming services, whether users would perceive this as opting out of a service and pay less or protecting their data on the platform and pay more.

**Purpose**
------
* Investigate users' awareness on their indirect contribution to  personalization in paid online streaming services

* Investigate whether there is early evidence of user preferences to recommend paid online streaming services to change their default personalization opt-in model to an optional service

* Discuss optional personalization as a means of enforcing users' awareness on their online data usage and data ownership

**Randomized Control Trial**
------
Number of participants: 527 (based on power analysis)

Sample attributes: 18-45 years old, based in the US

Panel Platform: Prolific

Survey Platform: [Qualtrics (closed for submission)](https://columbiaiserp.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0USGNWJ7l3EmGWO)

IRB Status: Approved by Columbia University IRB

**Data Availability**
------

-Main_Personalization_Preferences_12-18-21-raw_data_Qualtrics.csv: Original file directly downloaded from Qualtrics, includes all 530 participants. Treatment and control group responses are recorded in separate columns coded with “T” and “C” respectively e.g. benefit_4 variable is recorded as “11_C_benefit_4” for the control group and “11_T_benefit_4” for the treatment group.

-Filtered_Personalization_Preferences_12-18-21-raw_data_Qualtrics.csv: Three respondents were filtered based on the understanding check questions. At the very minimum, both the treatment and control group were expected to understand that their data would be used to recommend songs to themselves. 3 participants responded “no” to this question, and were filtered out.

-Cleaned_Modified_Personalization_Preferences_12-18-21-Qualtrics.csv: Using MS Excel tools, a column to identify control and treatment groups was added. Control and treatment columns were consolidated together e.g. column benefit_4 includes answers for both the treatment and control group, identified by the column “group”.

-Cleaned_Modified_Substituted_Personalization_Preferences_12-18-21-Qualtrics.csv: Main data set used in the analysis. Some blank cells (e.g. participants who never used PSPs in real life skipped relevant demographic questions) were substituted with NAs.

-Modified_Platforms_Used_Personalization_Preferences_12-18-21-Qualtrics.csv: A version that is used only for demographic questions relevant to participants’ experience with real life PSPs e.g. which PSPs they use in real life. These answers were recorded as a list in the original data folder and were tokenized in this modified version e.g. original answer “Netflix, Hulu” was tokenized as “Netflix:1, Hulu:1, Spotify:0…”
