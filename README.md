**Abstract**
------
In the realm of online personal data (OPD) sharing, extensive research has explored users’ willingness to accept compensation for sharing their data with online advertising-based platforms or their willingness to pay to safeguard their data privacy. Notably, paid streaming platforms (PSPs), exemplified by Netflix and Spotify, both charge users and leverage personal data for personalized services. Surprisingly, the existing literature lacks investigations into willingness to accept (WTA) and willingness to pay (WTP) for OPD concerning PSPs. In response, we conducted an online experiment to assess whether WTA and WTP concepts are applicable to PSP users, particularly when explicitly informed about how these platforms utilize their data. Our study results do not support the existence of WTA or WTP preferences among PSP users. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PSP users do not anticipate compensation for data sharing and do not view opting out of personalization, and consequently data collection, as a privacy feature they would be willing to pay for. Moreover, our data hints that individuals may be less concerned about sharing personal data for content recommendation, as opposed to online advertising. We encourage further WTA and WTP research within the PSP context, while acknowledging the limitations of our study for future researchers’ consideration. Additionally, we recommend exploring user perceptions of OPD collection in the context of content recommendation versus online advertising as a promising avenue for extending the existing literature.
