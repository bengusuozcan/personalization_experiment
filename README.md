**Introduction**
------
* Paid streaming services such as Netflix or Spotify do not leverage paid membersâ€™ data for online advertising and therefore not as much under attention as other platforms like Facebook or Google in user data research and ethics discussions. 

* However, these platforms leverage user data to improve their personalization algorithms which eventually serves to gain new users and retain existing ones.

* All paid members opt in for personalization by default without a chance to evaluate whether they are willing to receive personalization in exchange for allowing platforms to utilize their personal data.

* This study claims that when explicitly informed, users may perceive the usage of their data for personalization algorithms as a means of compensation and prefer paying less for the paid online streaming services.

* This study also aims to find if personalization was ever optional in paid streaming services, whether users would perceive this as opting out of a service and pay less or protecting their data on the platform and pay more.

**Purpose**
------
* Investigate users' awareness on their indirect contribution to  personalization in paid online streaming services

* Investigate whether there is early evidence of user preferences to recommend paid online streaming services to change their default personalization opt-in model to an optional service

* Discuss optional personalization as a means of enforcing users' awareness on their online data usage and data ownership
